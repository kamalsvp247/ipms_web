// Persistent in-house Cloudflare Turnstile solver.
//
// Mints real Turnstile tokens locally instead of paying a third-party provider.
// Headless Chrome navigates to the REAL page URL, but the top-level document
// response is swapped for a synthetic page containing only the widget + Cloudflare's
// own api.js. Only the response body is substituted — the URL itself is never
// changed — so location.origin, document.domain and the widget's referrer all still
// report the real hostname. The browser/Cloudflare handshake then happens for real,
// which is what binds the token to (site key, hostname): exactly the pair
// siteverify checks. IVAC uptime and its notice-page state are irrelevant, because
// no request ever reaches IVAC.
//
// Runs as a long-lived process (systemd: ipms-in-house-captcha) for the same reason
// the encrypt sidecar does: launching Chrome costs ~350ms plus a cold profile, but a
// warm browser solves in ~2.5-3s, and warm contexts can solve in parallel.
//
// Solve latency is ~93% Cloudflare's own dwell time: profiling a solve shows ~170ms of
// local setup (context + page + document swap) and ~2.4s waiting on the challenge
// sequence, whose last request lands at a near-constant wall-clock offset regardless of
// how quickly the earlier ones finish. Latency is therefore not meaningfully reducible
// and throughput comes from concurrency alone. Measured knee on a 16-vCPU host:
//
//   concurrency 4  / 1 browser  -> 1.12 solves/s,  96% success, p50 2.8s
//   concurrency 9  / 4 browsers -> 2.08 solves/s,  94% success, p50 4.4s  <- default
//   concurrency 16 / 1 browser  -> 2.04 solves/s,  98% success, p50 6.1s
//   concurrency 16 / 4 browsers -> 3.00 solves/s,  95% success, p50 4.4s  <- efficient shape
//   concurrency 24 / 8 browsers -> 2.32 solves/s,  95% success, p50 6.4s
//
// A solve costs ~4 CPU-seconds, so throughput is roughly cores/4: 16 in flight took ~13.5
// of the host's 16 vCPU.
//
// The shipped configuration is deliberately NOT any of those: it is tuned for a light
// footprint, because this host also runs the Java bot and the solver is idle most of the day.
// The unit runs concurrency 3 over 1 browser at CPUQuota=200%, and the pool is REAPED after
// CAPTCHA_SOLVER_IDLE_MS with nothing in flight. Measured effect:
//
//   idle, pool warm (old)   -> 1842 MB, 61 chrome processes, 712 tasks
//   idle, pool reaped (now) ->   21 MB,  0 chrome processes,  11 tasks
//   warm, solving (now)     ->  172 MB, 11 chrome processes
//
// The cost is one ~350ms cold start on the first solve after an idle window: 3.3s against a
// 2.5s warm solve. Raise CPUQuota before CONCURRENCY, and keep captcha:in_house_slots in step.
//
// More browsers is not monotonic — each carries a full browser-main/gpu/zygote/utility
// process set, so 24 over 8 throughputs worse than 16 over 4. Spreading a FIXED concurrency
// over more browsers does help p50, because one browser serialises its own CDP/IPC dispatch.
//
// Per-attempt success is a flat ~94-95% at every concurrency AND every source IP: it is the
// silent challenge-JS stall, and a fresh context recovers it. There is no Cloudflare per-IP
// throttle — a matched A/B at concurrency 24, once from the default egress address and once
// spread over 8 distinct source IPv6, scored 90% in both arms, and raising ATTEMPT_MS to 25s
// took the single-IP arm to 94%. What looks like a "collapse" at high concurrency is local
// queueing pushing latency into the ATTEMPT_MS cap. Do not add IP rotation for this.

 * removes them, and with idle reaping plus recycle-after-N the launch rate is high enough that
 * they accumulate indefinitely (46 directories, 31 MB, when this was found).
